/**
 * This interface represents an equation that calculates an individual's basal
 * metabolic rate (BMR).

 * Basal metabolic rate is influenced by several factors. This includes body weight,
 * lean body mass, height, age, the person's sex, etc. Formulas estimate an
 * individual's basal metabolic rate using these paremeters, though depending on
 * the formula, certain parameters are used or not.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once basal metabolic rate is calculated, normally an activity level is used to
 * provide the individual's daily calorie expenditure. <strong>This activity level must
 * be compatible with this formula.</strong>
