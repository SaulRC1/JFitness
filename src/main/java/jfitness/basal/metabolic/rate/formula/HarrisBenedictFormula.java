/**
 * This class represents the Harris-Benedict equation to calculate an
 * individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR).
 *
 * <p>
 * The Harris-Benedict equation also called Harris-Benedict principle is a
 * method used to estimate a person's basal metabolic rate (BMR). This basal
 * metabolic rate may be multipliead by a number corresponding to the
 * individual's activity level, leaving as a result the daily kilocalorie intake
 * to maintain current body weight.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Please, check more information about Harris-Benedict's activity level here
 * {@link jfitness.basal.metabolic.rate.activity.level.HarrisBenedictActivityLevel}
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The original equations were released in 1918 and 1919, created by James
 * Arthur Harris and Francis Gano Benedict and published by the Carnegie
 * Institution of Washington in the monograph
 * <a href="https://archive.org/details/biometricstudyof00harruoft">A Biometric
 * Study of Basal Metabolism in Man</a>.
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * In 1984 a revision from Allan M. Roza and Harry M. Shizgal improved its
 * accuracy {@link RozaShizgalFormula}. Also during 1990 there was a second
 * revision by Mifflin et al. which published an equation more predictive for
 * modern lifestyle. check {@link MifflinStJeorFormula}. Future articles
 * produced BMR estimators that used lean body mass, instead of traditional
 * parameters. check {@link KatchMcardleFormula}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Different equations are used for both men and women since the calorie
 * requirements per sex are not the same.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For Men --> <code>BMR (kcal/day) = (13.7516 * weight in kg) + (5.0033 * height in cm) -
 * (6.755 * age in years) + 66.473</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For Women --> <code>BMR (kcal/day) = (9.5634 * weight in kg) + (1.8496 * height in cm) -
 * (4.6756 * age in years) + 655.0955</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A common issue with this formula is that the calculation of the basal
 * metabolic rate does not take into account body composition, producing similar
 * results for a very muscular person and an overweight person who both share
 * the same age, height, age, weight and gender. Since muscle and fat require
 * different amount of calories to maintain, this formula will not be precise
 * for such cases.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The paper behind the last update of this formula (Mifflin et al), states that
 * all participants in the study are within the 'normal' and 'overweight' body 
 * mass index (BMI) categories. Hence the results do not necessarily apply to those
 * who fall in the 'obese' or 'underweight' BMI categories.
